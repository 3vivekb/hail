 - For testing we use ScalaCheck and TestNG.

 - Prefer

def foo() { ... }

to

def foo(): Unit = { ... }

In IntelliJ, turn off Editor > Code Style > Syntax > Other > Enforce
procedure syntax for methods with Unit return type.

 - Prefix mutable data structures with mutable.  That is, prefer

import scala.collection.mutable
 ... mutable.ArrayBuilder[Byte] ...

to

import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder
... ArrayBuilder[Byte] ...

 - Use require, assert and ensure liberally to check preconditions,
   conditions and post-conditions.  Define a validate member to check
   object invariants and call where suitable.
